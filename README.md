Abstract: Using data from the U.S. News and World Report on over 700 colleges and universities, I created a linear regression model that predicts
graduation rate based on selected features. My goal was to provide prospective college students insight on what statistics they should focus on when selecting their school. In exploratory analysis, I found five key drivers that were used to predict graduation rate: out-of-state tuition, number of new students enrolled, public or private, student/faculty ratio, and acceptance rate. In modeling, I set the baseline prediction to the mean graduation rate, which resulted in a root mean squared error of 17.14. I chose ordinary least squares linear regression to predict graduation rates, which had a root mean squared error of 14.49. This project contributes to research aimed at assisting high school guidance couselors, college advisors, and aspiring students.
